# Reels-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze my Instagram page data to identify patterns and insights related to audience engagement and posting strategies. By exploring key metrics such as accounts reached, plays, likes, comments, shares, and saves, I aim to answer critical questions about reel performance and engagement optimization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following fields:
- **Caption**: The description or hashtags used for the reel.
- **Upload Timestamp**: The date and time when the reel was posted.
- **Duration (seconds)**: The length of the reel in seconds.
- **Accounts Reached**: The number of accounts that viewed the reel.
- **Plays**: The total number of times the reel was played.
- **Likes**: The number of likes received.
- **Comments**: The number of comments made on the reel.
- **Shares**: The number of times the reel was shared.
- **Saves**: The number of times the reel was saved.

The dataset was exported from Instagram Insights and preprocessed for analysis.

## **Project Goals and Plan**
### **Goals**
1. Understand how posting times affect audience engagement.
2. Examine the relationship between reel duration and metrics like plays and accounts reached.
3. Identify trends in audience interaction, such as likes, comments, and shares.

### **Plan**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Convert timestamps to a consistent datetime format.
   - Create time categories (e.g., Morning, Noon, Evening, Night) for analysis.
   - Filter out incomplete or irrelevant data points.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of key metrics.
   - Compare engagement metrics across time categories and reel durations.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Create bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize trends.
   - Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between metrics.

4. **Future Goals**:
   - Use findings to propose actionable recommendations for improving reel performance.
   - Explore advanced methods like predictive modeling for engagement metrics.
